# Server-only (do NOT expose to client):
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: preferred model name (server-side only). If you want to expose a model selection to the client,
# use NEXT_PUBLIC_MODEL_NAME instead (but never expose API keys).

# Enable the client Service Worker (controls background caching and fetch interception).
# WARNING: enabling the SW may cause background network activity, periodic syncs, and
# increased server function invocations if the SW is allowed to prefetch API routes.
# By default the app does NOT register the SW unless this is explicitly set to 'true'.
# Set to 'true' to enable: NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SW=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SW=false

# Optional: restrict API calls to requests that include your origin in Origin/Referer.
# When set in production, requests from other origins will be rejected with 403.
# Example: NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://tldrwire.xyz
